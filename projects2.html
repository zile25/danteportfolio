                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">I was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of getting started with the project. After downloading the Prusa Slicer software I was able to easily upload the .3mf file and edit the 3d model to include my name and adjust the text to the middle of the nametag. Next I just clicked slice and after adding my color change was ready to upload to a flash drive. Next, I filled out the print job form and plugged in my usb drive. My first attempt at printing the filament was already loaded which was a good start however luck wasn’t on my side and the printer was suffering from a loose x-axis motor causing lots of overextrusion and layer shifting as shown in the picture of my red nametag. Relieved I hadn’t been at fault, I tried printing again and also practiced changing filaments to get the color I desired. There was a brief learning cure with the printers as you really have to apply pressure while being careful not to snap the brittle PLA. After a few tries I got the machine loaded and was happy to see all my layers lining up well. The color change also went well and I was able to complete my first print. It came out great except for a bit of blobbing on the 3d printer logo part of the name tag and some stringing but that has been a guarantee with our prints recently and Avery shared that a heat gun or hair dryer does a great job at blowing them away.

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">I used the 3D Benchy test and it came out pretty well. There was some under-extrusion and blobbing in a few places around the boat and lots of stringing but overall I was impressed with the Prusa’s performance. I also measured the print and compared it to the benchmark. I measured 6 distances on the print from 5-50mm and was always within a mm or 2 of the specified measurements on the 3D Benchy site. This test gave me strong confidence in the machines as when everything works they usually produce a consistent product given appropriate supports. I also learned .stl files are just 3d models while .3mf contains models and printer settings/color/supports information so when given the option I’ll usually be opting for the .3mf.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">For my print I picked something that is both an assistive device, designed by someone who’s mom has Cushing’s Disease, and something I can use at home. The device is a 3-way drink opener, The round toothlined circles allow those with muscle weakness to unscrew caps with a larger lever arm, lowering the force required. The far side leg had a traditional bottle opener which is always useful, and the near side is the perfect design to help open cans, something we all can struggle with, especially with short fingernails. After a hassle-free print, I tested out the device in these three scenarios and it worked great as well as being easy to use. There may be some durability concerns but these can be addressed by using a stronger material than PLA. The documentation for the print was helpful and showed me how to install the two cylindrical grids onto the main structure. Overall I would definitely recommend it as the print will be a useful tool for anyone.
