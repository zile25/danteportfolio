        <h4>Part 1: CAD Orientation </h4>
        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
            I really enjoyed using both Fusion and Tinkercad for the first time. My learning process involved watching through the tutorials given to the class and then as I was working on my designs I used ChatGPT and looked up extra questions I had specific to the designs I was working on. There are many intricacies to these software platforms and the more knowledge the better. Tinkercad was definitely a little bit more user friendly but I also enjoyed the power of Fusion when I got it to do what I was intending. Both sets of tutorials did a good job explaining various aspects but I would say it is a much easier task to learn a lot about Tinkercad quickly than Fusion. The simple model I chose was a rocket as you can see above. My result in Tinkercad looks much more arcadey while the Fusion product looks clean and industrial but some of this may come down to how each displays the models. Assembling in Tinkercad mostly involved using premade shapes and sticking them together while in Fusion I had to use sketches and build tools to make shapes, I especially enjoyed using the loft and shell tools and how they give the nosecone and rocket motor eye pleasing curves.

        <h4>Part 2: Tinkercad Remix</h4>
        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
             
When scrolling through online 3D models I had seen many F1 tracks are available to download and it is a great use of 3D printers as the tracks only need a few layers of filament in a specific shape and now you have a model track that would cost $50+ to have on a poster. I also saw an old style F1 logo which consisted of a stand and an F and a 1 that caught my eye. My idea was to shave off parts of the stand that were unneeded and place the 2 blocks that were within a F1 track. I first laid this out in my sketch and then brought the F1 logo stand into Tinkercad before removing most of the material by building “hole” rectangular boxes around the parts I wanted to preserve. This left me with the 2 small cubes I wanted, the great part about CAD was it perfectly remembers the distance between the letters so I could just add in the F1 track model and move it so both boxes were just inside of the track so the model could be 1 combined object. I then imported my .3mf file into Prusa Slicer. I didn’t adjust many print settings as the print was very horizontal so I didn’t need to worry about support. I did bump the infill up to 20% to improve build quality. I also printed out the F and 1 as you can see in the final product, they were very straight forward and I followed the same pattern with no supports and 20% infill. I’m really happy about how it came out and the letters fit snugly into their stands, this did achieve its goal of looking interesting and I look forward to keeping it around the house. Some design improvements could be editing the letter stands to better mesh with the track, maybe fusing together the edge of the track and the stand cubes in Tinkercad to make the design really feel like one integrated concept.

        <h4>Part 3: Fusion Remix</h4>
        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
            When looking through online 3D models I try to find things I’ll be able to keep at home. One useful object is an Xbox controller stand. Many versions are available online but the one I picked interested me because of the open space I could add designs to. As you can see in the pictures the inside face of the stand has 2 great locations for embellishment on the top and bottom. I picked out a different F1 track to add to the bottom part and an F1 driver’s logo for the top. I now had 3 mesh files loaded into Fusion and first added the track which was easier as both models were parallel with the ground so I just had to adjust the z axis and Fusion has good feedback of depth for models and I was able to group the two. Next, I aligned the logo with the angled face of the stand, I utilized specific values in Fusion where snapping to the nearest mm was imprecise so I changed the values by 0.1mm until the layers matched up well. Now that I had the mesh the way I wanted I grouped the objects together and converted to a solid. I now exported to Prusa Slicer and used my settings from earlier but with large amounts of material being printed with nothing below I added in supports “everywhere” which did use extra time and material but allowed the print to come out very well and are satisfying to break off. The design works great and you can see it in use with a controller in the pictures. I do have 2 controllers so a cool modification would be expanding the design with another shelf which could involve adding another ground support and with the extra room maybe more F1 track layouts. With the extra weight from the second controller, I’d probably also increase the infill to preserve structural integrity.
