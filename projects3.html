                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We are assembling the small radio for this project. Looking through the manual it is definitely on the simpler side telling us which parts to solde
                                r where and not much else. This is still helpful though and it was fun to solder for the first time in over a year. There were a couple hiccups and we had to use the sol
                                der sucker and copper wire to clean up mistakes. The assembly went well and our final piece, the microchip, was the hardest. Soldering the small contacts in close proximity requ
                                ired precision and pre-loading the contacts on our PCB allowed us to focus on attaching the chip and not how much solder was needed for each contact. The image above shows o
                                ur final assembly with the screen, buttons, and microchip on a PCB and a separate speaker and battery. We also used the digital calipers to gather measurements as we started
                                 designing our enclosures. The acrylic enclosure included in the kit was 4.17in x 3in x 1.1 in. The speaker was 2.8in x 1.6in x .95in. The main PCB was 2.45in x 1.7in x 1.0
                                 5in and the battery was 3in x 0.83in x .85in.

      <h4>Part 2: 3D Printed Enclosure</h4>
      <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We then used these measurements to start to design our 3D printed enclosure. Another choice we made was to use a box with finger joints and 6 sides as this design ca
        n be both 3D printed and laser cut, so we won’t need to design a completely different enclosure for the next part. The image above Part 1 shows our 1st draft enclosure where we made sure our m
        easurements were accurate and could sketch further upgrades to the enclosure. Our 3 components fit well in the test enclosure so we added extra affordances to the design as shown in the notebo
        ok sketch for the enclosure. These affordances are the 4 mentioned in the lab, controlling the buttons, hearing the speaker, moving the antenna, and changing the battery. The cutouts in the to
        p and front pieces cover these affordances and we also added a battery holder which is a raised lip on the bottom piece to keep the battery from sliding around too much. We then printed this 2
        nd iteration and the picture is the box with the red lid. However, the button holes didn’t include enough margin so we had to increase the size of the cutouts in fusion which allowed us to fi
        t all the components properly. As the pictures show the red box couldn’t be properly closed while our final design with the yellow lid fully closed and included all the affordances we wanted
         to include. Our 3D print settings are also shown, we used the standard Prusa settings we have been using with 15% infill and no supports as all sides of the box are printed separately and d
         irectly onto the build plate. Fusion was helpful for printing as the 3D print setting can export individual bodies from the same file which was helpful for separately printing out the 6 sides of our box.</p>

                          <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">After testing our final 3D printed enclosure we knew our tolerances and cutouts were the right size. Thanks to using a finger joint box we can extrapola
                            te the same fusion design into lightburn for our laser cutter. Unfortunately because the laser cutter is 2.5D (thickness is set at 3mm) the battery holder won’t be part of this de
                            sign as we can’t add thickness to the bottom piece of the box. For our cut we exported all the pieces of the box in a .DXF file which was then loaded into lightburn where the piec
                            es can be arranged next to each other to minimize wasted wood on the square pieces of wood. The first result went well except we did have to recut 1 side piece as it had become sl
                            ightly different after exporting from Fusion. After cutting this final piece and assembling we had our final laser cut box as we can see in the image above. This design also inclu
                            des the main affordances we designed for like using the buttons, hearing the speaker through the “FM Radio” cutout, adjusting the antenna, and changing the battery by taking off t
                            he lid of the box before reattaching. I enjoyed the process of this project and learned a lot about manufacturing with 3D printing and laser cutting.
